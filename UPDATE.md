# Commit Details
- Various changes
- Renamed ``GitHubButton`` to ``RepoButton`` to better correspond with it's actual purpose.
- Moved ``root/styles`` to ``root/components/styles`` since it's only being accessed by it's parent folder.
- Discord button opens directly into Discord, which is cool, but i'll probably change it back to the HTTPS URL.
